# About This Directory
The 'Save' directory contains shortcuts to all folders that should be backed up from this file management system instance.
This folder tracking directory represents the Save directory of this network's imaginary archive instance.

## Default Content
- README.md: This directory's documentation file.

## Additional Content
- Empty directory placeholders of any files and folders you want to back up. Ideally, these are only files and folders that can't be easily incorporated into this instance network any other way.
